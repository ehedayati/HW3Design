\textcolor{Red}{\textbf{Questions:}}
Joe wants to travel back to his hometown during Thanksgiving break. The capacity of the car that he owns is that he can travel up to $i_{max}$ miles once the tank is full. He finds the gas price on all of the gas stations in his rout to home prior to start the travel using the google map service. Assume that the distance between each two consecutive gas station is less than $i_{max}$ and each station has different rate for fuel. How can Joe minimize the cost of his trip. Consider the fact that Joe can fill the car's tank for a fraction of the capacity too.
