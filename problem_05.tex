A freelancer wants to maximize his earning in each day. He has a pool of jobs that he can choose from, each with different time required to complete and different earning which does not have any relation ship with the time cost of the job. There is an upper limit $m$ hours for the time that he can put each day. All of the jobs require less than $m$ hours to complete. How can he maximize his earning in each day from the given posted jobs in the morning?

\begin{enumerate}[A.]
	\item Does this problem has an optimal substructure? if so explain it.
	\item The sub-problems are overlapping? explain why.
	\item If your answer to part A. and B. was yes, give a dynamic programming algorithm to solve this problem. Your algorithm should use a bottom-up approach to build a table with the optimal solution.
\end{enumerate}
