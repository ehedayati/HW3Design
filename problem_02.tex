\textcolor{Red}{\textbf{Questions:}}
While solving the activity selection problem, Joe makes a claim that even if we select the last activity to start that is compatible with all previously selected activities, this greedy algorithm still finds a maximum subset of mutually compatible activities. Is his claim correct? Prove your answer.

\textcolor{Green}{\textbf{Sample Solution:}}
Let $S_k$ be a given maximum-size subset of $A_k$(all given activities), and let $a_i$ be the specific activity with the latest start time. If $a_i \in S_k$ then we are done, because our greedy choice is already in the given optimal solution. If $a_i \not\in S_k$, we can simply find the activity with the latest start time in $S_k$ and replace it with $a_i$. In this case, we are not creating any overlapping, because $a_i$ start time is later than the removed activity. The new $S_k'$ is still a maximum-size subset of $A_k$ that has mutually compatible activities. Thus our greedy algorithm will provide an optimal solution.
